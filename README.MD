While poking around some systems programming books and manual pages I came across setjmp and longjmp. After reading through the man pages, I thought it would be an interesting exercise to implement these two calls using x86 assembly. The idea is quite simple: allocate a struct to hold the program counter and top of the stack where esetjmp() is called. When elongjmp() is called, the stack pointer is restored to the top of the stack saved in the struct and the execution jumps to the saved program counter. Only tested on X86_64.
